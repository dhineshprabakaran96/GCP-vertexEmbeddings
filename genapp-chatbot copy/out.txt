To create an image pull secret, you can follow these steps: 
	1.	Login to the registry.ford.com and create a robot account in your organization.
	2.	Create a file called credentials_config.json with the following contents:


```
{
  "username": "YOUR_USERNAME",
  "password": "YOUR_PASSWORD",
  "email": "YOUR_EMAIL"
}
``` 
	3.	Use the following yaml to create a secret in the tekton namespace:


```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: image-pull
data:
  .dockerconfigjson: <base64-encoded contents of credentials_config.json>
type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
``` 
	4.	Once the secret is created, you can use it to pull images from the registry.ford.com by using the following command:


```
docker pull registry.ford.com/<image-name>:<tag> --secret=image-pull
```
