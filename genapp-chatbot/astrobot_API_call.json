  "question": "What are some best practices for designing and implementing alert rules in Astronomer Airflow?",
  "response": "The best practices for developing and executing alert rules in Astronomer Airflow include:\n\n* Using the BaseOperator that all Airflow Operators inherit from. This allows you to configure each task individually as needed by turning off email notifications by default at the DAG level.\n* Using Astronomer Astro Runtime images. Make sure the image tag version matches the runtime version specified in your deployment. Custom images will not be supported.\n* Using the KubernetesExecutor for Airflow deployments unless CeleryExecutor is required.\n* Tearing down development deployments when not in use."
